Dear ....,

Thanks for showing interest in Lefthoek. I greatly appreciate it.

We are currently not yet rolling out our product to the general public. At this
stage, we are ready to work with three selected launching customers to tailor
our virtual team member to their specific needs.

Concretely, we are looking for organizations that match the following profile.

+ Your primary contact with customers is online

+ Your team intensively uses slack or a similar collaborative messaging apps

+ Your organization is rapidly growing

+ You have high employee turnover and/or many flex workers

+ You have an open company culture

+ You are familiar with open-source development processes

+ You have a strong desire to optimize online team communication and
collaboration

If you recognize your team and organization in this description, let's arrange a
(virtual) meeting as soon as possible!

If you want to talk to me about Lefthoek for any other reason, let's meet up for
a (virtual) cup of tea too!

Enjoy your day!

Jan Hein Hoogstad
