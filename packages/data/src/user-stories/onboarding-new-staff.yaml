title: Onboarding New Staff
rating: 5
story:
  as a: |
    COO of a fast-growing Scale-Up that currently onboards at least 20 new
    employees a week, something that puts an enormous strain on both the 
    work pleasure and effective productivity of senior staff members.
  I want: |
    a team member who is fully dedicated to onboarding new employees by 
    answering their question, pointing them to the best, and most up-to-date
    sources of information both on- and offline
  so that: |
    new employees are productive in 50% of the times than it currently
    takes, while also taking 50% less of the team's time
