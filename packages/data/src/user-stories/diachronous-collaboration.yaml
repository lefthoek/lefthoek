story:
  As a: |
    project manager of a remote team with members in multiple time zones who loses
    too much time and money due to a lack of common availability of her team
    members.
  I want: |
    a team member who's available around the clock and provides my team members
    a concise overview of everything that is discussed and decided in their
    absence at the start of their shift.
  So that: |
    an increase of 75% in information retention amongst team members who are not
    working at the same time, thereby dramatically reducing the time I spend on
    manual handovers and crisis management by 90%.
