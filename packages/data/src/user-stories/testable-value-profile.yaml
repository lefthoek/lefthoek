title: testable value profile
rating: 5
story:
  As a: |
    CEO of a value-driven online company where there are constant, productivity
    and pleasure threatening, tensions between teams responsible for attaining
    commercial targets and those that guard our ethical values.
  I want: |
    the online activities of all my teams to be automatically tested against a
    value profile that consist of both our commercial targets and ethical
    values. Vice versa this value profile periodically should get evaluated and
    recalibrated based on the de facto activities of my team.
  So that: |
    all teams operate from an undisputed, aligned set of values. As as result,
    productivity is raised by 150% without endangering the ethical values of my
    company.
