title: brand image damage control
story:
  as a: |
    head of customer experience at a large computer manufacturer that manages 
    its after sales through social media
  I want: |
    a team member who is available 24 hours per day and adequately reacts to 
    negative customer experiences on social media within one minute
  so that: |
    90% of the initially negative posts will ultimately lead to a positive 
    reaction by the same customer, thereby transforming potential brand 
    image damage into a marketing opportunity
