What's the brand color now? I used 'bright green' again, just to be sure.

I'm off for the weekend. Have fun everyone!

Good Morning, Alicia! Hope you enjoyed your break.

These things have been decided in your absence:

- headings should be formatted in 'titlecase' from now on.

- all design changes should be tested on our brandbook site before updating them
  on the homepage

The following proposal is waiting for your approval:

- change the primary brand color from 'bright green' to 'sky blue'
