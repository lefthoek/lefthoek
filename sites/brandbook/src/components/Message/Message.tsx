Good Morning, Alicia! Hope you enjoyed your break. 

These things have been decided in your absence: 

+ Headings should be formatted in **uppercase**{data-text-transform="uppercase"} from now on

+ All design changes should be tested on our [brandbook site](https://brandbook.lefthoek.com) before updating them on the homepage 

The following proposal is waiting for your approval: 

+ Change the primary brand color from **bright green**{data-color="brightGreen"} to **sky blue**{data-color="skyBlue"}
