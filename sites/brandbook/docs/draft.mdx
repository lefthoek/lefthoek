### Onboarding

Why perform repetitive tasks when machines can do them for us?  

Would more time and effort have lead to equal &mdash; let alone better &mdash;
results?

To them, the idea of automating tasks clashed with their scholastic
romanticism. The mere idea of a computer that could release them of the boring
parts was an insult to their very existence. 

We are told from a very early age that we have to suffer through laborious
tasks to succeed. In fact, our whole education system is build on this idea, It
needs a fair amount of unlearning before we can progress as a species.

Mechanization and automation have only produced more jobs over the last 200
years, and will continue to do so. They mostly replaced jobs that were close to
slavery anyways. If anything, robotics and AI will make us more human.

The future of AI will be local and contextual.
