# Lefthoek Brandbook

Lefthoek solves the problem of knowledge spill. A lot of critical information in
organisations is not stored and processed properly, if at all. As a result, lots
of time-consuming tasks are repeated over and over again. 

One has to practice what one preaches, however. And that's the sole purpose of
this site. It is the place where we collect all the documents that are relevant
for those new to Lefthoek. 

Maintaining a collective document like this, is not easy. That's precisely
the reason that most companies don't manage to do it. 

In order to prevent this very scenario, I came up with a few guidelines how I
want us to handle documents and information at Lefthoek.


1. When in doubt, keep it

Information that may appear as noise to you, can be critical to someone else. 
Time is a reality distortion field. Once you've learned something, you cannot
reverse it. As as result, things that are actually quite hard to find out, can
appear to be simple all of a sudden. 

Beware of this fact, when you are wondering: is this document worth keeping? Did
it take you a substantial amount of energy to discover or learn it? Then the
answer is most likely, yes.


2. Information is not just texts

While it may be the majority of the information that we share with each other,
other modes of information are just as important to store. 

When it is not immediately apparent how a piece of information can be conserved
on this site, it's probably a good sign that it should. Spend considerable time
and energy to find a way and discuss this with others.

This also brings us to the next rule.

3. Clean up after yourself

The fact that a document is for internal use, doesn't mean that presentation
does not matter, on the contrary. In my opinion, internal and external
information are not two completely different things. They are different layers
of the same building. 

In this metaphor, internal documents would be the foundation. The stronger the
foundation is, the more stable the building as whole will be.


4. Refactor periodically

Archiving does not mean: never touch anymorel. Revisit and refactor existing
documents periodically. Luckily, documents are not set in stone any longer. Act
accordingly. 

Since this brandbook is stored in git, version control is taken care of
automatically. Edit as much as your heart desires. The team can always decline
the pull request or revert to an earlier version later.

5. Respect quality content, not important people

Good content is good content, no matter who wrote it. Vice versa, everyone can
produce subpar content, even me. Don't think a document cannot be improved
because it's written by someone who is more experienced than you. 

Again, thank god we have good version control. No change is irreversible.
If you see an opportunity to improve a document, please do so. Don't hold back.


6. Public by default, private by exception

At Lefthoek, you need a strong reason not to share information with others and
even the outside world. Hardly ever, is something so critical that it needs to
be protected from other people's eyes. When in doubt, just ask, otherwise publish.


7. Make it part of the agenda

Literally. Every meeting should have the status of the brandbook on the agenda.
What should be stored, updated, removed, etc. Information management is
