# Founder Story

For as long as I can remember, I have loved cutting corners. Nothing beats the feeling of achieving something substantial while putting in substantially less effort than others. Some use the expression 'working smarter, not harder' to describe this process, but this phrase never really cut it for me. 


## Survival of the Clumsiest

In hindsight, I would probably argue that my love for cutting corners was born out of plain survival. As a kid, my development was already marked by contradictions. While I could already read and write before starting primary school, my motor skills were equally exceptionally weak. 

In practice, this meant that I could not manage to hold a pen in the proper way. This made writing by hand slow and even physically painful for me. As a coping strategy, I quickly developed the habit of minimizing the activity as much as possible and, if possible, avoid writing altogether.

Throughout the years, many a teacher felt that it was her calling to help me overcome this handicap. Every tool at her disposal was used to introduce me to the wonders of the pen: special caps, rewarding stickers, public jest and ridicule. 

Nothing worked. I remained true to myself. I had already developed a way to write. Why waste precious time and effort on learning another one?


## The Template of Doom

Soon after I discovered the word *idem*, it became the most frequently used word on my tests. Why write something twice, if once suffices? Idem felt like a magic word. Better yet, it felt as a command that held special powers.

Not coincidently, I discovered computers and programming around the same time. Loops released me from even having to repeat the act of writing the magic word:

```basic
10 print "Yeehaa Was Here!!!!!"
20 goto 10
```

This discovery made me question everything I learned in school thus far. Why
perform repetitive tasks when machines can do them for us?  

The power to delegate boring, repetitive tasks to machines manages to impress me until this very day.  Why don't we use it a lot more?


## Just Passing By

Above anything else, it was the dire boredom of high school that shaped my disposition to cut corners into a skill. 5.5 &mdash; the minimum passing grade in the Dutch education system &mdash; was my favorite result. It proved that I put just the right amount of effort in learning things that were not going to be useful later on. 

In fact, my first year' high school teachers were so troubled by my lack of interests in the official curriculum that they decided to hold me back even though my grades were sufficient to pass to the next year. As justification for the Tip-Ex on my report card, they came up with the following explanation:

> Jan Hein shows little to no interest in his school work.   
> We find him too involved in extracurricular activities.

And that was a completely accurate assessment. 

If only they had understood it as a reflection of their own performance. 


## Motivation Slips

School failed me. Most teachers were completely unable to motivate me. 

Matters were further complicated, however, by the fact that I was far from your typical underachiever. I was reading Dostoevsky by 12, president of both the student parliament and the news paper, and joined a national political party by 15. But for all the things that I could not see the reason behind, cutting corners became the one and only way of life.

I was more than willing to make an effort whenever something made sense to me, but equally blatantly refused to do them when it didn't. Mandatory attendance and punctuality were two of the things that I couldn't wrap my head around. 

When my school tried to introduce a system of hallway permission slips, I successfully sabotaged its introduction by printing their template sheet in the school paper. 

Best thing was, that I managed to do so with explicit permission from the dean. He even provided me with the official template. How did I manage to convince him? Simple, I told him that the article that I wrote about the new system would benefit from a visual illustration... 

... and I had promised to invalidate the template by putting another magic word on it. 

```
SPECIMEN
```

Which I obediently did! This amazing command that renders real things fake was clearly included on ONE out of FOUR slips.


## Digital Native 

Understanding the corner cutting powers of computers gave me a competitive advantage. I was, what people would now call, 'digital native' in the stone age of computers. A fact that I was all too eager to rub under everyone's noses at the time.

In the third grade, I lost my computer room key privileges after a friend and I reorganized the keys on all the 30 or IBM Model M's in the class room. 

```
QWERTYUIOP                    ABCDEFGHIJ
ASDFGHJKL                     KLMNOPQRS
ZXCVBNM                       TUVWXYZ
```

This was one of the few times in high school that I didn't feel the need to cut any corners. The alphabetization process would take us an entire afternoon. But it proved to be well worth the effort. The next day, all computer classes were disrupted. No student learned to use WordPerfect or Lotus123 that day. 

At the time, my peers were far from digital native. It turned out that they hadn't even entered the age of the typewriter. Was I to blame for their discomfort? 

Up until this very day, I maintain that it's debatable.


## Lazy Santa

Even family events were not exempt from my striving to do more with less. I think the following anecdote tells the entire story best. 

I once gave my mother a basket of old, dirty laundry as a present. I know what you are thinking, but not even I am that mean. It was part of a dutch tradition in which Secret Santas makes mocking gift for each other. This practice usually consists of a lot of mediocre arts and crafting, but that's something I neither understand nor appreciate. For me, the whole purpose of the tradition was the mocking; the better the joke, the better the effort.

At the time, my mother just went back to art school and was constantly complaining about her domestic tasks. So what better present than to give her some relief from her chores? 

A week before the holiday, I wrapped up the laundry basket in wrapping paper. By Sinterklaas evening, everyone had been complaining about missing socks and panties for days.

Was my lack of effort bad? I would strongly argue against it. 

I don't think any other Sinterklaas gift has ever made as much of an impression
in our family. Decades later, everyone still talks about it every year. The
anecdote has been passed on to the next generation. Would more time and effort
have lead to equal &mdash; let alone better &mdash; results?


## The Eternal Recurrence of the Same

My attitude got a complete make over when I started university. Well at least, when I gave it second try. 

At the end of a dramatic first year of studying Russian in Leiden, I transferred to Philosophy in Utrecht. This choice that initially started as an easy way to acquire the credits for my scholarship quickly became so much more. 

For years, philosophy remained my biggest passion. I wanted to learn everything and, as such, slacking became less of a goal. Instead, my corner cutting activities were now aimed at achieving more, not doing less.

Most of the classes offered did not go deep and fast enough for my taste. So I approached professors with an alternative proposal. Instead of attending their class, I would write a paper related to the subject. Saving them of the time and energy of having to deal with a highly critical in their classroom. Don't remember any professor that ever refused my offer. 

Nor did any one of them ever notice that I recycled up to 80% of earlier papers. 


## Master Teacher

My first true teacher, Willem van Reijen, was a wise man. Wise enough to realize that he could not teach me anything anymore after I graduated. 

So when it was time for me to start the PhD, he sent me out into the world; to his friend, Friedrich Kittler in Berlin. A man, whose fame and merits were completely unknown to me at the time.

Friedrich Kittler was the first and only person that I have met that truly understood the powers of computers. And I was in complete awe.

After attending his graduate seminar for two years, I finally found the courage to ask him to read an early draft of one of my thesis chapters. A text that comprised of a grand total of 12 pages double spaced A4.  

In response to my request, Friedrich kindly proposed the following: 

> Could you please bring it back to 3 pages?    
> And highlight the most important passages with a marker   
> Thank you!   

I was flabbergasted and even a bit insulted at the time. Now I realize that this is the best lesson that he ever taught me. 


## Social Justice Warrior

As a teacher, I was never inclined to reward other students for effort either. The grades that I gave were based on the results achieved, not the time that it took them to get there. At times, I even thought of grading systems that penalized superfluous use of time and effort.

Of course, this lead to plenty of complaints from the self-perceived hardworking, ambitious students: 

> It's not fair!   
> I worked 40 hours on my paper    
> And he did it in only two    

Up to the present day, I uphold that this objection doesn't even deserve an answer. The complaint does not make any sense to me.


## Uplifting Eduction

At the time, higher education's disdain of efficiency didn't discourage me at all. If anything, it actually fed directly into my own particular brand of OCD. Unprofessional organizations are filled with opportunities to cut corners, especially when it's considered a vice to do so. 

Among the experiments that I conducted as a teacher and administrator, these were some of the most controversial ones:

+ Splitting a seminar in two smaller groups Only offering each group a bi-weekly session.

+ Peer grading of exams and papers.

+ Giving a grade to an entire class rather than the individual students in it.

+ Grading a group of students during the first session. Making all subsequent
ones optional

Honest to god, I maintain that none of these measures ever negatively affected the quality of my teaching. On the contrary!


## Subhuman Resources

Academia was never the right environment to appreciate my anti-scholarly mindset. You expect that smart people would value getting to results quickly, but the opposite was true. 

Even the fact that I had the secretary making photocopies was met with great suspicion. How stupid of me to think that there were tasks that could be delegated to people that were hired to do them.

But an assistant professor is ill-positioned to optimize the system. So when the chance arose, I signed up to become the Humanities department's HR Manager as a side-hustle.

My first task was to facilitate the roll-out of the newly introduced mandatory teaching certificate to the existing teaching staff. This measure was anticipated with great anxiety by both staff and administration. For opposite reasons: the staff did not want to do it, the administration wanted to have it done. A political minefield for an inexperienced HR Manager that just started.

Asked how I would approach assessing such a great diversity of experience, my immediate answer went along the following lines:

> Just give the certificate to them    
> Some of them have been teaching for over 20 years    
> They have proven their skills already   
> And, if not, they are not going to improve them anymore anyway.

Everyone pretended to be appalled by the suggestion. Half a year later, we actually ended up rolling out something only nominally more substantial. 

Cutting corners was the right thing to do.


## Do Repeat Myself

Despite minor victories against the bureaucratic apparatus, however, I never felt very confident in my new role as a lazy superhero: teacher by day, HR Manager by night. The cocktail of a hyper optimizing mindset and an environment heavily reluctant to be subjected to it, had been doomed from the start. In 2012, my inevitable burn/bore out became a fact. 
 
It could not have come at a better time! The time-out enabled me to reconnect with a lost love. The early 2010s, marked a true renaissance of computer literacy. And I passionately wanted to be part of it. 

Ruby impressed me with it's clear syntax and its thinking man's mentality.
Open Source offered a refreshing perspective on intellectual property and collaboration. While the creative coding and data visualization community showed me that research no longer needed to be textual.

Most importantly, the coding community was the first environment that apparently shared my cutting corners mentality. When I first discovered that the three great virtues of a programmer were *laziness, hubris, and impatience* I could not have been happier. 

Everything turned full circle, when I discovered the acronym *D.R.Y* stood for *Do not Repeat Yourself*. I was home at last.


## Crossing Over

So I started plotting a career shift. 

When I read about the up and coming coding bootcamps in Wired Magazine in the fall of 2012, I was immediately sold. This was the kind of (re)education that I had been looking for all my life. No years of boring classes, but 12 weeks of highly intense training in a pressure cooking environment. 

I signed up for Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco the same day and got accepted for the summer cohort in 2013 a few weeks later. It felt like a chance to redeem myself. This time around, I would do things differently. No more corner-cutting. In my new career, I was going to be an overachiever. 

But waiting six months for a new career to start, is a long time. And was not impatience supposed to be a programmer's virtue? In the months between enrollment and the actual program, I thus read, watched, and listened to everything I could find about coding. I did not stop with the topics offered in the curriculum either: frontend, backend, database management, everything felt urgent and necessary. 

Working hard can never harm, right?

Wrong! After only two weeks of being a student, the program coordinator told me that they I already knew everything that their curriculum covered. I have never been more disappointed in my life. Dev Bootcamp felt sorry and promoted me to teacher/tutor for the rest of the summer.

But I needed another teaching gig like I needed another a hole in my head. 

In hindsight, I blame it on karma. My debt for being the most impossible student ever hadn't been yet fully repaid. I had to stay a teacher a few years longer.


## Cutting the Humanities

So my plans changed once more. 

Instead of shifting careers, why not bring the insights from my new practice back into my old one? At the time, I truly believed that academia was ready for a revolution. Maybe I took *hubris* a bit too literal?

Back at the University of Amsterdam, I tried to apply my newfound coding superpowers to revitalize my academic career. 'Coding the Humanities' was an attempt to mobilize all the former dreamers and slackers into my classroom into an army of creative coders. It kind of worked, until it didn't.

Students were amazing. And we quickly grew into a small global community of learners that didn't want to waste their talent by engaging in month long programs and degrees. 

More surprisingly, was the fact that the administration was very supportive too. It took little effort to convince the Dean of the appeal of using coding education as a vehicle to modernize the faculties outdated offerings. It did not hurt that our proposal promised to an easy solution to scale up group sizes, and easier employment for a student demographic that is traditionally difficult to place either.

Only problem were these same colleagues that complained about me not making my own photocopies. To them, the idea of automating tasks clashed with their scholastic romanticism. The mere idea of a computer that could release them of the boring parts was an insult to their very existence. 

There is something tragic about people's deeply rooted resistance against mechanization and automatization. It is as if they believe they deserve to do repetitive work. I guess there is still some Marx in me.


## Roadside Picnic 

Offcourse was born in the fall of 2014 as Unacademic. Both names express my conviction that there is no universal recipe for learning. 

Students ought to be taught to carve out their own paths; cut corners when opportunities arise; takes detours when a straight, narrow road does not feel right; or simply stop for a while and enjoy the view. Lifelong learning should not just mean extending the journey, the path should also be paced differently.

I've long considered program curriculums &mdash; and their smaller sister: the course syllabus &mdash; to be the main obstacle to truly personalize learning. These age-old instruments have turned education into the equivalent of a slalom course. 

Although a student may be theoretically allowed to plot her own trajectory. The whole parkour is designed to prevent her from doing so. 

In our education system, a student is:

1. Expected to reach a uniform, common goal

2. Required to pass all the tightly spaced flags along the way

3. Expected to set a competing time.

With Offcourse, I problematized the first step while keeping the other two in tact. What happens if you replace a uniform, common goal, with one that the student sets for herself? How would a curriculum and/or syllabus look like when students no longer follow a single parkour?

Ironically, my answer to these questions came in the shape of a glorified recipe app. 


## Cut to the Chase

I quit my job. Convinced that education was the next industry that was going to be disrupted. And Offcourse was ready to shake it up.

But starting a business alone was not enough of a challenge. So I decided to make it a bit harder for myself. Just making money was too mundane. My company, no my initiative, no my movement, would be so much more than that. 

Offcourse needed to be:

+ Value-driven  

+ Open-Source

+ Nonprofit

+ Community Driven

+ Bootstrapped

+ Bla Bla Bla

I now realize that without a working business model, my so-called ethics were nothing but an opinion. And we all know how the [famous saying about opinions
](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Opinions%20Are%20Like%20Assholes) goes. 

Put differently, I forgot to stay true to my corner cutting self. The optimal way to achieve your goal, is the one that delivers the best results with the least amount of effort.


## Value Driven Development

While strong values didn't build a strong business, it did differentiate Offcourse from other companies, especially those in the technology space. And in the years following, this ethical dimension of our profile became increasingly important. Ironically, I would argue that this literal *value proposition* gained more traction than the one that we were actually trying to sell.

In 2013, only a few internet activists were concerned with the ethical implications of the platform economy. If anything, most people were lauding its democratizing potential. But that sentiment drastically changed in the years that followed. 

Public got wary of filter bubbles, fake news, and targeted ad campaigns. In
2018, every aspiring startup added at least one slide about their ethical values to their pitch-deck. Miss Universe would be proud.

Fortunately for me, awareness of the ethical implications of technology increased in less superficial ways too. Public institutions started to realize that they were now highly reliant on online tools that were build on very different values than their own. More importantly, they became aware that these platforms actually implemented ethical choices that ran counter to their public task.

It was from this realization that the PublicSpaces initiative arose. A coalition of Dutch public institutions that aimed to reclaim the governance of their online communication channels. Due to the ethical positioning of Offcourse, I was quickly brought on as a consultant. 

After their initial &mdash; understandable but naive &mdash; idea to build their own social network proved to be unfeasible, I was asked to develop a strategy for the future of the project. I came up with the following three principles:

1. Focus on adoption. There is no ethics without users.

2. Embrace existing solutions. Don't reinvent or compete with them.

3. Align on shared, and even diverging, values. Do not obsess about the way they are implemented.

In the case of PublicSpaces, these three principles soon led to the development of the Public Badges: an evidence-based certification system for ethical values on the internet. 

To me personally, however, these three principles are the lessons learned from the first five years of being a so-called social entrepreneur. As such, they will guide each and every project that I will work on in the future.


## The Future is Artificial

Turns out that a life of corner cutting does not lead to a shorter journey after all.

But through all of this, there is this lurking feeling that there is still a disruptive product in me somewhere. Something that brings all these things together. Or better yet, a company that starts to eliminate all these unnecessary, laborious tasks one by one. 

The Bots with an Attitude concept that I developed for Planet B in 2019 was a first attempt to explore that concept. Asked to develop an online infrastructure to facilitate this project's remote team, I came up with a swarm of always available bots that complement, but not replace, the human team members.

While the concept may have been radical. I now find it not radical enough yet. It's experimental for the sake of being experimental, and thus does not cut the corners enough yet. 

For the next iteration of this product, I think the following principles should be leading:

+ People need to be familiarized with the idea that cutting corners is a good thing. We are told from a very early age that we have to suffer through laborious tasks to succeed. In fact, our whole education system is build on this idea, It needs a fair amount of unlearning before we can progress as a species.

+ Only optimize professional practices that are open to the idea of change.
Don't worry about the rest. They will perish soon anyway.

+ Start with low hanging fruit. There are still so many unnecessary, boring tasks that could be automated that are now done manually, that we may not even have the desire to automate the high hanging fruit once we get there.

+ Mechanization and automation have only produced more jobs over the last 200 years, and will continue to do so. They mostly replaced jobs that were close to slavery anyways. If anything, robotics and AI will make us more human.

+ Technology is still full of untapped potential. Neither Google nor Facebook is going to get close to fully utilize it any time soon. Creative tactics will always win from all-encompassing strategies.

+ The future of AI will be local and contextual. Understanding irony should be the new Turing Test. As long as there is no general AI that can capture all winks and jokes  under all circumstances, there will be plenty of ways out of surveillance capitalism. Lighten up folks!
