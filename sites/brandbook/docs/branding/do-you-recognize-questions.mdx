+ You keep hiring smarter people, but your organisation does not get more intelligent

+ You keep hiring creative people, but they spend their days discussing the background color of your homepage

+ Your teams work don't work with but against each other

+ You have a company wiki that no-one ever uses

+ Onboarding takes a long time, sometimes longer than people are working for you

+ You have defined company values but every team - or even employee - seems to use a custom set

+ There is a lot of knowledge in your organisation, but most of it is stored in the brains of a few, senior employees

+ You spend a lot of time investing in long term strategies, that prove to be out-of-date aftr a month or two

+ Your market is in constant flux, but your organisation is not equipped to proactively change

+ You want to be able to turn off your phone once in a while, but you haven't done so for years

+ You are bored by your own products and services

+ You want to be more daring and cutting edge, but are afraid it will scare off your loyal customer base

+ Your number 2 (and 3, 4, 5...) does not make a single decision without running it by you

+ Your company's advanced technology actually consists of a bunch of unethically cheap employees in Indonesia

+ You don't understand what your CTO is saying, so you just give her what she want so that she stops whining

+ Your IT budget has risen exponentially the last few years, but there does not seem to be a correlation with the results

+ You have an amazing custom BI dashboard with all kinds of useless information

+ You say that you make data-driven decisions, but you know that it's a lie. Unless you count your gut feeling as a data point.

+ Your employees use your intranet and chat environment as their internal Facebook

+ You have heard that there are some private channels dedicated to gossip about you, but you don't know how to find them

+ Those expensive, external data scientists that you hired just found out that you'll sell more products if you cut the price by 90%

+ Those same data scientists proactively teamed up with the aforementioned creatives. They collectively decided that the answer is 'teal'.
