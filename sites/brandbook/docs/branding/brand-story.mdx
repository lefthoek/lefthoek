Remember the time that you were truly excited about your work? 

Back then, you didn’t have a lot of money, a large team, or fancy offices. The only thing on your mind was building an amazing company that was highly impactful and truly disruptive. 

Back then, you were determined to reach this goal as quickly as possible, by any means necessary. 

Back then, work was fun!

Do you ever wish you could revive this corner-cutting mindset?

Now you can! 

It all starts with unlearning to value effort as such. Talent deserves to work on matters that matter. Purpose comes from urgency, necessity, and pleasure. Every task that lacks those qualities can and should be delegated to machines.

Cutting corners is not about working less: it's about achieving results faster, more creative, more ambitious, and less wasteful.  By design, computers are aligned with these goals. Alas, we often forget or refuse to ask for their help. Not because we don’t want to, but because we don’t know how. 

[brand name] unleashes the full corner-cutting power of computers. We release your team's untapped potential by adding an extra member to it. And our local, contextual AI will never let anyone down. This new colleague will release your team of boring, laborious, and difficult tasks, such as:

+ Quickly and carefully reply to negative customer experiences across all social media

+ Ensure that your team members across multiple time zones always have access to reliable, up-to-date information

+ Gamify the competition between different teams by making desired values and targets testable.

[brand name]’s corner-cutting AI, allows your team to be smarter, more creative, and more productive with far less effort. 

At [brand name], we believe that cutting corners is a virtue not a vice. We have been developing clever tactics to avoid boring, laborious, mind-numbing tasks since 1975. Now, we will start offering them as a service.

Make work fun again! start cutting corners!
