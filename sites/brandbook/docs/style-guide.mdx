Our customers are designers, architects, creative people who enjoy curating
their spaces to feel like home. They appreciate high-quality, thoughtful design.
They are likely middle-class with some disposable income, and treat furnishing
their home as an investment. They’d rather save up and buy well-designed,
beautiful things rather than the cheapest things available just to get
furnishing over with.
