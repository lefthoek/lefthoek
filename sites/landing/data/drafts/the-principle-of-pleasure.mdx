excerpt: |
  Hedonism has a bad reputation. Often misguidedly equated with egotism, it is
  quickly dismissed as an immoral position. But this rejection, may be caused by a
  misunderstanding of the concept of pleasure, or even fear to acknowledge it's
  full potential.

Pleasure is a principe. One we should never compromise.
