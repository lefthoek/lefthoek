excerpt: |
  In our current society, we use certain labels to identify ourselves 
  in this vast and dynamic world. These labels help us navigate the
  different contexts active in the current modern society. Moreover, 
  they are now more so propagated on the internet as a tool to brand 
  ourselves with or amongst others, in the diverse online communities.
  Consequently, this how the ideals of digital citizenship were born.
  One Terry Hieck highlights the  frame of digital citizenship as a 
  reflection of "the "quality" of habits, actions, consumption patterns,
  that impact the ecology of digital content and communities." Have a
  read and see which persona you identify with the most!

As we gear-up for the incoming 4th Industrial Revolution, a large part of our
society will be grouped into key roles as we more into a more tech-driven era. 
Whether directly or indirectly, you are a participant in this monumental shift in
society and are therefore part of this revolution. Here at Lefthoek we try to 
understand our current society through 5 different personas. Taking into consideration
both past and present experiences that has led us all to this forthcoming era, we 
believe we all had an important part to play. *The question is, what digital citizen
do you identify yourself as?* We believe this label is fluid and can evolve with the 
changing times. Nonetheless, which persona do you relate with the most currently ?

***Dreamers*** are individuals who have always been present in society since the 
dawn of time. These individuals learn quickly about life and eventually find the
current state of affairs mundane. They tend to create big dreams for a 'better' 
world and themselves. They strive to obtain the fruit at the top of the tree! 
This metaphor very well describes their goals but also forebodes the high risk
they are willing to take. The fruits at the top of the tree are usually hardest
to obtain. Moreover, they are not always ripe. Dreamers are willing to risk it
all, in order to materialise their dreams. One prime example of a dreamer today
is Elon Musk. Musk is determined to take humans to wifi0-working Mars in the next
few years. A dreamer's passion usually overtakes the common expectations of a 
society. This passion also gives us drive and communal ambition. Do these dreams
materialise? Only time will tell...

***Laika***, this was one the first animals to pioneer space exploration. Retrieved
as a stray dog from the streets of Moscow, she became the first dog to explore
space under the notable Soviet space envoy Sputnik 2 in 1957.  [This notion is
still practiced
today](https://www.businessinsider.nl/animals-nasa-russia-space-agencies-sent-to-space-2019-6?international=true&r=US#:~:text=Countries%20including%20the%20US%2C%20the,send%20animals%20into%20orbit%20today.)
but might sound incredulous to some and many may even be inclined to call on
PETA for such a cause today. Nevertheless, this was an unexpected feat during 
the Space race era. During the Cold War, the space race pushed visionaries/dreamers
and fellow politicians to align their ideals to achieve huge leaps in terms of 
space exploration. This collaboration then brought about new key players, such as
Laika, that provided society with much insight in possibilities debated under 
Space exploration.  Laikas are not intentional players, they are random intermediaries
that factually illustrate the possibilities and the limitations society, through 
trial and error. Laikas were the one's who take the driver's seat. They are and 
continue to be the failed encounters that teach us something valuable about our dreams.
They are our insights and lessons learnt.

Characterized as the over-ambitious cousins of the dreamers, ***Moonshooters***
come armed with awareness, time and money. This title was ["first
introduced in Jules Verne’s From the Earth to the Moon but popularized by
president John F. Kennedy in 1961.](https://www.lefthoek.com/blog/the-low-end-theory/)" 
Moonshooters are passionate about solving the world's current wicked problems but 
fail to understand that the input of other disciplines and expertise is necessary. 
Also it is important to note that not all the of the problems in the 21st century 
can be solved through technology. Like the name suggests, "moonshot" conveys an idea
that the issues they try to tackle are often a 'long-shot'. This means it  has a high
probability to not work. This also highlights the fact that moonshot projects are 
done without any prior, concrete research of potential risks and benefits. The
moonshooter label falls on those those who are doers rather than thinkers and act 
first, instead of reflect. Much like the dreamers that dream big, they take it step
further and try to realise the actual project as soon as possible. They are the big
risk-takers, willing to act timely then later find out the barriers or issues that 
are present. They would make a great in tandem team with fellow dreamers.

Imagine a huge river, with currents leading in one strong direction. If you were in
the waters, which way would you swim? ***Passengers*** are individuals that would go
with the flow.  Have you heard of the saying that "dead fish go with the flow"? This
harsh reference contextualises the notion of effort which can be used to weigh the 
involvement of passengers in the incoming tech revolution. Passengers can viewed as 
a myriad of individuals that are not necessarily "involved" in the disruption of the
tech industry. They are part of the audience. This role is just as important as 
Passengers still retain much of the responsibility and agency in this journey towards 
a tech-driven future. Passengers have the power to interchange trains, get off and also 
change modes of transport etc. In view of the growing digital space, they thus have the
agency to choose which apps are much more useful to the society and which technologies
should be embraced or given room evolve. They are can also be seen as cheerleaders as 
they provide insight on which innovations are interesting or are the best bet moving foward.

As the name suggests, this persona is quite self explanatory. ***Spectators***
can be seen to be similar to passengers, but the huge differnce being, they 
relinquish their agency of choice and intuition to the powers that may be. 
Just like the passengers, they are curious and are willing to take a risk 
by being involved, but only passively. They also go with the flow, but with
very few inhibitions. Spectators can also be seen as observers and members 
of the audience. This also means they can still have an opinion on the matter
but their vested interest is not as strong as the other personas.

Last but not least, we have the ***Fruit-pickers***. On a linear scale, they
could be placed between the dreamers and the moonshooters. They are action-driven
much like the moonshooters but they strive for simpler and more efficient solutions,
whislt making use of the resources that are within reach. Like a fruit farmer, they
are aware that it is much easier to take the fruit that is on a lower branch of the
tree than it is getting the fruit at the top of the tree. The world's wicked problems 
should also be handled in this manner, but you find particularly in the tech industry, 
innovations to "pick the fruit at the top of the tree" tend to materalise much more 
often than simple solutions aimed to get the fruit on the bottom branch. Fruit-pickers
masters in understanding the low-end theory. Read more about this theory in our 
previous article [here.](/blog/the-low-end-theory/)
