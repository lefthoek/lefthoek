  Everyone seems to be working on moonshots nowadays, because... well... Google
  does it. Google's approach is to take an unsolvable problem and pump a
  shitload of resources into it. Most others only copy the unsolvable problem bit.
  True to it's cutting corner mindset, Lefthoek leaves shooting at moons to
  Google and its copy-cats and picks low-hanging fruit instead.

In 2010, Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin asked their buddy Astro Teller to
front an experimental company builder mysteriously called [X - The Moonshot
factory](https://x.company/).  The single roman numeral signifies almost
religious belief in exponentiality that both X and it's mother company hold. X
promises to only invest in ideas that could make at least a 10x (Xx, get it?)
impact over the status quo.


X's recipe for the moonshots that their factory produced consisted a of two
simple steps:

1. Take an unsolvable problem    

2. Spend a shitload of money on it  

Over a decade later, we can decisively conclude that this approach has lead to a
massive amount of inspiring Wired covers.  Whereas the solutions to the world
biggest problems that they promised to solve, seem to be as distanced as 10
years ago. But hey, those [Google

did make you look cool in 2014, am I right?

### Copy Cat

More impressive than X's actual solutions may be the amount of copy cats that this
moonshot factory actually inspired.
