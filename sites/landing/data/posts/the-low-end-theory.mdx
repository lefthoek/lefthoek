excerpt: |
  Everyone seems to be working on moonshots nowadays, because... well... Google
  does it. Google's approach is to take an unsolvable problem and pump a
  shitload of resources into it. Most others only copy the unsolvable problem
  bit.  True to it's cutting corner mindset, Lefthoek leaves shooting at moons
  to Google and its copy-cats and picks low-hanging fruit instead.

In 2010, Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin asked their buddy
[Astro](https://hanna-barbera.fandom.com/wiki/Astro) Teller to front an
experimental company builder mysteriously called [X](https://x.company/). The
single roman numeral signifies the almost religious belief in exponential logic
that both X and its mother company hold. X promises to only invest in ideas that
could make at least a 10x &mdash; Xx, get it?  &mdash; impact over the status
quo. 

The projects that X engages with are appropriately named
[moonshots](https://www.thegeniusworks.com/2020/02/a-decade-of-moonshots-alphabet-x/).
An term first introduced in Jules Verne's [From the Earth to the
Moon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_the_Earth_to_the_Moon) but popularized
by president John F. Kennedy in 1961. In his famous speech, Kennedy promised
congress that he would get a man on the moon before the end of the decade.
Moreover, and equally important, the president also pledged to bring this man
back safely to earth.  Eight years and $25.4 billion dollars &mdash; that would
equate to $150 billion in today's economy &mdash; later, Apollo 11 managed to
fulfill that promise.

X takes this idea one step further by refering to itself as a moonshot factory.
The company doesn't just embark on nearly impossible missions, but aims to make
these journeys mass-producible. Its mission does not consist of solving one
*particular* impossible problem, but finding the recipe to solve *any*
impossible problem. X's blueprint for producing moonshots consists of three
simple, repeatable steps:

1. Focus on an unsolvable problem    

2. Spend a shitload of money on it  

3. Sell the resulting solution

Over a decade later, we can indisputably conclude that X's moonshot recipe has
lead to a massive amount of inspiring Wired covers. Whereas world's biggest
problems seem to be as unsolvable as 10 years ago. But hey, those [Google

## Counterfeit Moon Shooters

More impressive than the actual solutions that it has produced, may be the
amount of [copy cats](https://www.moonshot-factory.eu/en/missions/) that X has
inspired since then. Over the last decade, many an agency, incubator, or VC firm
has reinvented itself as a moonshot factory. 

While the marketing material of these counterfeit moon shooters was mostly
copied one-to-one from X's website, closer inspection reveals that they did in
fact made some small but significant changes to the original formula. In true
[Shenzen fashion](https://nostarch.com/hardwarehackerpaperback), they added a few features and removed some others.

1. Focus an fashionable problem    

2. Ask for a shitload of money 

As we speak, the tech world is overflowing with aspiring moon shooters searching
for generous sponsors and benevolent donors. Entrepreneurs no longer look for
investors to fund their solutions. Instead, they look for those that will let
them solve the world biggest problems. Give these aspiring Elon Musks enough
money and they will cure cancer, stop famine, and end poverty. Or so they claim.
Humanity and humility share little more than a few common letters.

## Flying Low

Lefthoek consciously chooses not to aim for the moon. We leave pride and glory
for others, and are perfectly satisfied to do the things that need to be done
and no one else seems to care about. Moreover, we are commited to solve them
with the simplest technology possible. 

Lefthoek loves low-hanging fruit: the lower the fruit, the sweeter the juice. In
everyday tasks, there are so many small problems that could make your work a
more fun and satisfying. These could be things like:

+ Onboarding a new staff member that feels lost at the new job

+ Storing and retrieving all the interesting links that your team members shared 

+ Summarize all the messages that you missed during your vacation

Lefhoek is dedicated to solving all of these issues and many more, one at a
time: by as few means possible. That, in short, is what *the low end theory* is
all about.
