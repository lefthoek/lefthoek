  Everyone seems to be working on moonshots nowadays, because... well... Google
  does it. Google's approach is to take an unsolvable problem and pump a
  shitload of resources into it. Most others only copy the unsolvable problem bit.
  True to it's cutting corner mindset, Lefthoek leaves shooting at moons to
  Google and its copy-cats and picks low-hanging fruit instead.

In 2010, Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin asked their buddy
[Astro](https://hanna-barbera.fandom.com/wiki/Astro) Teller to front an
experimental company builder mysteriously called [X](https://x.company/). The
single roman numeral signifies an almost religious belief in exponential logic
that both X and it's mother company hold. X promises to only invest in ideas
that could make at least a 10x &mdash; Xx, get it?  &mdash; impact over the
status quo. 

The projects that X engages with are appropriately named
[moonshots](https://www.thegeniusworks.com/2020/02/a-decade-of-moonshots-alphabet-x/).
An idea from Jules Verne's [From Earth to Moon]() that was popularized by John
F.  Kennedy in 1961, when he promised congress to have a man on the moon.
Moreover, and equally important, Kennedy also pledged to bring this man back
safely to earth before the end of the decade. Eight years and $25.4 billion
dollars &mdash; that would equate to $150 billion in today's economy &mdash;
later, Apollo 11 managed to fulfill that promise.

X takes this idea one step further by refering to itself as a moonshot
[factory](). X doesn't just embark on nearly impossible missions, but aims to
make these journeys mass-producible. Its procedure for producing moonshots
consists of three simple, repeatable steps:

1. Focus on an unsolvable problem    

2. Spend a shitload of money on it  

3. Sell the resulting solution

Over a decade later, we can decisively conclude that this approach has lead to a
massive amount of inspiring Wired covers. Whereas world's biggest problems seem
to be as unsolvable as 10 years ago. But hey, those [Google

do make you look cool while cruising your [Waymo](https://waymo.com/), right?

More impressive than X's actual solutions may be the amount of [copy
cats](https://www.moonshot-factory.eu/en/missions/) that X has actually
inspired. Over the last decade, plenty an agency, incubator, or VC firm has
reinvented itself as a moonshot factory. 

And while the marketing material of these copy cats was mostly copied one to one
from X's website, they did made some small but significant changes to X's formula.

1. Focus an unsolvable problem    

2. Ask for a shitload of money
