  Everyone seems to be working on moonshots nowadays, because... well... Google
  does it. Google's approach is to take an unsolvable problem and pump a
  shitload of resources into it. Most others only copy the unsolvable problem
  bit.  True to it's cutting corner mindset, Lefthoek leaves shooting at moons
  to Google and its copy-cats and picks low-hanging fruit instead.

In 2010, Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin asked their buddy
[Astro](https://hanna-barbera.fandom.com/wiki/Astro) Teller to front an
experimental company builder mysteriously called [X](https://x.company/). The
single roman numeral signifies an almost religious belief in exponential logic
that both X and its mother company hold. X promises to only invest in ideas that
could make at least a 10x &mdash; Xx, get it?  &mdash; impact over the status
quo. 

The projects that X engages with are appropriately named
[moonshots](https://www.thegeniusworks.com/2020/02/a-decade-of-moonshots-alphabet-x/).
An idea from Jules Verne's [From Earth to Moon]() that was popularized by John
F. Kennedy in 1961. Kennedy promised congress that he would get a man on the
moon before the end of the decade. Moreover, and equally important, the
president also pledged to bring this man back safely to earth. Eight years and
$25.4 billion dollars &mdash; that would equate to $150 billion in today's
economy &mdash; later, Apollo 11 managed to fulfill that promise.

X takes this idea one step further by refering to itself as a moonshot factory.
The company doesn't just embark on nearly impossible missions, but aims to make
these journeys mass-producible. X's blueprint for producing moonshots consists
of three simple, repeatable steps:

1. Focus on an unsolvable problem    

2. Spend a shitload of money on it  

3. Sell the resulting solution

Over a decade later, we can indisputably conclude that this approach has lead to
a massive amount of inspiring Wired covers. Whereas world's biggest problems
seem to be as unsolvable as 10 years ago. But hey, those [Google

do make you look cool while cruising your [Waymo](https://waymo.com/), right?


## Counterfeit Moon Shooters

More impressive than the actual solutions that it has produced, may be the
amount of [copy cats](https://www.moonshot-factory.eu/en/missions/) that X has
actually inspired. Over the last decade, many an agency, incubator, or VC firm
reinvented itself as a moonshot factory. 

While the marketing material of these counterfeit moon shooters was mostly
copied one-to-one from X's website, closer inspection reveals that they did in
fact made some small but significant changes to the original formula. In true
bootlegger's fashion, they added a few features and removed some others.

1. Focus an fashionable problem    

2. Ask for a shitload of money 

3. Market the resulting company

As we speak, the tech world is overflowing with aspiring moon shooters searching
for generous sponsors and benevolent donors. Entrepreneurs no longer look for
investors to fund their solutions. Instead, they look for those that will let
them solve the world biggest problems. Give these aspiring Elon Musks enough
money and they will cure cancer, stop famine, and end poverty. Or so they claim.
Humanity and humility share little more than a few common letters.

Every moon has a dark side. small problems aren't
considered worthy of anyone's time and attention any longer.

Lefthoek consciously chooses not to aim for the moon. We are here to pick up the
low-hanging fruit instead. In our everyday work, there are so many small
problems that need solving.
