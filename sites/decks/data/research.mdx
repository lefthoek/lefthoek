# Team Cognition as Emergent State

The manner in which knowledge important to team functioning is mentally
organized, represented, and distributed within the team and allows team members
to anticipate and execute actions

# Emergent States

Emergent states further describe the ‘cognitive, motivational, and affective
properties of teams [that are] . . . dynamic in nature and vary as function of
team context, inputs, processes, and outcomes.

(Marks et al. 2001, p. 357).
