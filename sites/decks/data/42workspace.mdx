# Goal

Exponentially increase the **collective intelligence** of coworking spaces by
connecting them, and the broader tech scene, through an common online space.

</Basic>

# Challenges

</SectionCover>

---

<Basic>

# Value Knowledge

Sharing best practices and information is an often unfulfilled selling point of
coworking. A **common online space** could be used to both drive these practices of
knowledge exchange and involve people that would not have been able to be
participate otherwise.

</Basic>

---

<Basic>

# Fortify Values

Coworking could be so much more than just renting an office, but it demands an
awareness of the **responsibility and generosity** needed to create a
community. Making people aware of these values when cohabiting virtual rather
than physical spaces demands even more effort.

</Basic>

<Basic>

# Broaden Circles

There are a lot of specialized professionals amongst the members and alumni of
coworking spaces. If one would manage to engage their respective networks as
well, the potential for **fruitful collaborations** would be even bigger. The
problem that needs to be solved is finding one and another.

# Virtual Coworker

<SellingPoint iconName="Microphone" title="moderates">the communication between
the between the different circles of coworkers</SellingPoint>

<SellingPoint iconName="Binders" title="organizes">the information that human
and virtual coworkers share with each other over time</SellingPoint>

<SellingPoint iconName="Hologram" title="augments">the resulting collective
knowledge base with information acquired from other relevant
sources</SellingPoint>

# Proposition

<SellingPoint iconName="Wrench" title="Radical Automation">Lefthoek aims to
automate every laborious and boring chore that can be automated. Any missed
opportunity to do so inevitably results in talent waste.</SellingPoint>

<SellingPoint iconName="Apple" title="Low-Hanging Fruit">While hardly ever
succesful, most AI initiatives focus on so-called moonshots. Lefthoek takes the
opposite approach deliberatly tackling the 90% first.</SellingPoint>

<SellingPoint iconName="BasicShapes" title="Complexly Simple">There is a common
misconception in technology that complex solutions are superior. Lefthoek is
based on the exact opposite. Simple is always better. </SellingPoint>

</Icons>

# Approach

<SellingPoint iconName="A" title="A For Agency">Replicating human intelligence
is both too ambitious and too restrictive as a goal for AI. Lefthoek chooses to
focus on intelligence that has agency rather than being
artificial.</SellingPoint>

<SellingPoint iconName="Swarm" title="Swarm Agency">Rather than chasing the
pipedream of an all-encompassing general AI, Lefthoek is growing a living ecosystem of
many, narrow single-purpose services.</SellingPoint>

<SellingPoint iconName="HamsterWheel" title="Human In The Loop">On collaborative
messaging apps, it is childishly simple to put an AI in a continuous feedback
loop with its users. Almost as if they were designed for
Lefthoek.</SellingPoint>

# Middlemen

In offline coworking, the aforementioned challenges are most commonly solved by
voluntary or involuntary facilitators. To create succesful online spaces the
roles that these middlemen perform need to be moved online and/or automated.

# Game Maker

'Pay it forward ' is a crucial practice for healthy coworking.  However, most
people are not inclined to do it by nature. The game maker continuously sets
**challenges and rewards** to encourage people to share knowledge and best
practices with each other.

# Cocktail Shaker

Circles of people have a tendency to become stale. The cocktail shaker
periodically connects people from different circles based on interest,
personality, and a hint of randomness. On top of that, the shaker also creates
the setting for this **unexpected encounter**.

# Tie Breaker

In any coworking environment, violations and clashes of values will
occassionally occur. The tie breaker resolves such conflicts on the
basis of transparent rules, open procedures, and **feedback loops** to
prevent decisions from becoming technocratic.
