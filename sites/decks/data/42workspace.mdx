<Basic>

# Value Knowledge

There is a lot of interaction between members at 42 workspace, during lunches,
lectures, drinks, and parties. Alas, there is little to no **interaction** on 42's 
online platform 'Bisner'.

# Fortify Values

Coworking could be so much more than just renting an office. But it demands 
a degree of **responsibility**  and **generosity** that not all current members share.

# Encounter Serendipitously

There are a lot of highly specialized professionals amongst the present members
and alumni of 42 Workspace. This could potentially lead to many fruitful
collaborations. Problem is that they have difficulties **finding** one another.
