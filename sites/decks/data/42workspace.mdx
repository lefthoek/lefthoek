# Lost Encounters

There are a lot of highly specialized professionals amongst the present members

# Shared Exposure

Most of the flex workers and startups within 42 workspace are still working on
building their customer base. In this early phase, they could benefit greatly
from doing **acquisition** together, but this hardly ever happens.

# Community Values

Coworking could be so much more than just renting an office. But it demands 
a degree of **responsibility**  and **generosity** that not all current members share.

# Online Engagement

There is a lot of interaction between members at 42 workspace, during lunches,
lectures, drinks, and parties. Alas, there is little to no **interaction** on 42's 
online platform 'Bisner'.

# Tech Lead

The metaphorical pie for the Rotterdam tech scene could be so much bigger if
companies would work together. 42 Workspace could play a leading role in forging
these, but lacks a solid **online infrastructure** to facilitate this.
