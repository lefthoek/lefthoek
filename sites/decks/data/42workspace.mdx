# Lost Encounters

There is a lot of highly specialized professionals amongst the present and past
members of 42 Workspace. This could potentially lead to many fruitful
collaborations. Problem is that they have difficulties **discovering** one
another.

# Lack of Exposure

Most of the flex workers and startups within 42 workspace are still working on
building their customer base. In this early phase, they could benefit greatly
from doing **shared acquisition**, but this hardly ever happens.

# Community Values

Coworking could be so much more than just renting an office. But it demands 
a degree of **responsibility**  and **generosity** that not all current members share.

# Online Engagement

There is a lot of interaction between members at 42 workspace, during lunches,
lectures, drinks, and parties. Alas, there is little to no **interaction** on 42's 
online platform.
