Virtual team members that mix business with pleasure

## Narrow Minded

<Notes>

Narrow Minded
=============

Mentioning 'Narrow AI' in a converstation will most likely result in an
underwhelming response. Overloaded with news about self-driving cars and almost
human-like virtual assistants, hardly anyone gets excited about projects that
are actually defined by their limited reach.

A similar attitude can be discerned when it comes to deep learning. Nowadays,
both developers and entrepreneurs are quick to dismiss all other forms or AI and
Machine Learning. Nonetheless, more often than not these 'antiquated'
technologies are often more suited to solve the problem at hand.

In my opinion, this narrow minded view on AI and its technologies leads to a lot
of missed opportunities. 

At Lefthoek we choose to focus on this low-hanging fruit. There's a lot of
(relatively) simple real world problems that, are not deemed worthy by those
only interested in moonshots.

In this presentation, We use a combination of different Narrow AI (or not even)


Some of the techniques and technologies that I'll discuss in this presentation
are:

+ Local, client-based AI (TensorflowJS/Tensorflow Lite)   
+ Cellular Automata   
+ Rule-based AI   
+ Human in the Loop
