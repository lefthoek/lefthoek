## Narrow Minded

<Notes>

Narrow Minded
=============

Mentioning 'Narrow AI' in a conversation will most likely result in an
underwhelming response. Overloaded with news about self-driving cars and
human-like virtual assistants, hardly anyone gets excited about projects that
are actually defined by their limited scope and reach.

A similar attitude can be discerned when it comes to deep learning. Nowadays,
both developers and entrepreneurs are quick to dismiss all 'lesser' forms of AI and
Machine Learning. While, in fact, these 'antiquated' technologies are often more
suited to solve the problem at hand. This narrow minded view on AI and its
technologies leads to a lot of missed opportunities. 

My company, Lefthoek, thus chooses to focus on low-hanging fruit. There's a lot
of (relatively) simple real world problems that are not deemed worthy by those
only interested in moonshots. Moreover, there are a lot of simple, underused
approaches and technologies that can prove to be very effective to solve
aforementioned problems. Examples of them are:

+ Local, client-based AI (TensorflowJS/Tensorflow Lite)   
+ Cellular Automata   
+ Rule-based AI   

In this session, I will explain how Lefthoek combines a multitude of narrow AI's
with collaborative messaging platforms (slacks, microsoft teams) to create an
overarching 'human in the loop' environment.

# Goal

To show that combining many narrow AI's is a better approach to solve real world
problems than to focus on general AI and moonshots.
