# Challenges

<Basic>

# Siloed Knowledge

There is a lot of highly specialized and thus valuable information present
amongst Nofagroup's employees, but it is **scattered** throughout the
organization.

# Hidden Expertise

A substantial part of an employee's expertise is acquired on the job. As a side
effect, however, this knowledge remains undocumented and thus
**untransferrable** within Nofagroup.

---

<Basic>

# Compassion Deficit

Nofagroup's employees are aware of the value of factual data. They are less
appreciative of **human** processes and practices.
