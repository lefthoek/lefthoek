amongst Nofagroup's employees, but it is **scattered** throughout the
organization.

# Hidden Knowledge

A substantial part of an employee's expertise is acquired on the job. As a side
effect, however, this knowledge remains undocumented and thus
**untransferrable** within Nofagroup.

<Basic>

# Unvalued Knowledge

Nofragroup's employees are aware of the value of factual data. They are
less conscious when it comes to knowledge of **human practices**.
