voluntary or involuntary **facilitators**. Online, people that fulfil these
roles and corresponding tasks are often lacking.

Among those middlemen there are a few that really excel at these facilitating
tasks. These super connectors are essential for creating and growing **healthy
circles** &mdash; organizations, networks, and ecosystems.

it is important to create a **safe environment** in which founders can phrase
and shape their asks. Nurturing hosts facilitate this process.

# Activating Moderators

To ensure that super connectors have an incentive to prioritize helping
founders with their asks, they have to be kept engaged through various **forms
of gamification**. Activation Moderators facilitate this process.
