### Return on Ecosystem

Towards a connected online space to raise the dutch tech ecosystem

</Cover>

---

<Basic>

# Goal

To use the knowledge, experience, and skills of superconnectors to develop a
**connected online space** to raise the Dutch tech ecosystem.

</Basic>

---

<Basic>

# Opportunity

The presence of many different tech communities and ecosystems that each have
their own online platforms, but lack a **shared infrastructure** that connects
them.

</Basic>

---

<Basic>

# Solution

Piggyback on the seen and unseen efforts of super connectors to connect the
unconnected. Support their activities through **facilitation**, **gamification**, and
**artificial intelligence**.

</Basic>

---

<Basic>

# Unfair Advantage

A **curated group** of super connectors hand-picked from the combined networks
of Up!Rotterdam, Global Tech Advocates, Innovation Quarter, and Tech Leap.

# Scalable Artifacts

<SellingPoint iconName="Placeholder" title="Bulletin Board">
Unfulfilled asks of the ecosystem are displayed on a real-time bulletin board
along with the points that can be earned by the super connecter that solves
them.
</SellingPoint>

<SellingPoint iconName="Placeholder" title="leaderboard">
Points are attributed to the super connector that solves the ask. They are
ranked and displayed in real-time, so that their contribution to the ecosystem
becomes visible.
</SellingPoint>

<SellingPoint iconName="Placeholder" title="dashboard">
Facilitation and gamification combined reveal data points. This data can be
monitored on a real-time dashboard that shows the state of the ecosystem.

# Outcomes

<SellingPoint iconName="HighFive" title="Fulfilled Asks">
By helping founders to make their ask specific and make it precise, it becomes
easier for the super connector to actually find the right people to fulfil the
ask.
</SellingPoint>

<SellingPoint iconName="Diamond" title="Qualitative Metrics">
The combined steps of filtering, sharpening and ranking the asks, makes it
possible to differentiate between the type of matches and make decisions that
follow these acquired insights.
</SellingPoint>

<SellingPoint iconName="SwordAndShield" title="Fortified Reputation">
By rendering their effort visible, in the form of a leaderboard, and
worthwhile, by tying them to real-world rewards super connectors have a
justifiable reason to free up time to help founders.
</SellingPoint>
