# Goal

Exponentially increase both the **collective intelligence** and **individual
ownership** within Springest

</Basic>

<SectionCover>

# Challenges

</SectionCover>

---

<Basic>

# Valuing Knowledge

Making space for knowledge management in **everyday practices** is difficult. At
Springest, roles and tasks were created to solve such problems, but they are
never top of mind.

</Basic>

---

<Basic>

# Critical Agency

Employees of Springest are expected to have a **proactive attitude** towards
finding answers and solutions. In practice, not everyone turns out to be equally
capable of handling this responsibility.

</Basic>

---

<Basic>

# Smooth Onboarding

Even the most promising talents will not immediately meet the high demands of
Springest. As a result, **aligning expectations** of exisiting and new
employees can be challenging.

</Basic>

---

<Basic>

# Visible Milestones

Not all messages are created equal, but in collaborative messaging apps they are
presented as such. One of the drawbacks of a stream-based approach is that
even **major milestones** disappear too quickly.

</Basic>

---

<Basic>

# Meaningful Metrics

Getting the right answers alone is not enough. Having insight in the queries
requested by your employees tells a lot about your organization and its
challenges. This critical **feedback data** is often elusive.

# Scrivener

The scrivener classifies and structures all your team's conversations, it
automatically compiles your knowledge repository, and even highlights the bits
the events that are most important to you and your team members.

# Greaser

Team communication sometimes needs a little bit of oil to keep going smoothly.
Onboarding is one of these circumstances. Scaling is another. The greaser stages
serendipitous encounters and just encourages people to share experiences with
each other.

# Trainer 

The trainer provides you with actionable feedback to improve your knowledge
management and team communication based on the conversations that you, your team
members, and lefthoek's AI have on Slack.
