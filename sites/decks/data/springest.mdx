# Goal

Exponentially increase both the **collective intelligence** and **individual
ownership** within Springest

</Basic>

# Challenges

</SectionCover>

---

<Basic>

# Valuing Knowledge

Making space for knowledge management in **everyday practices** is difficult. At
Springest, roles and tasks were created to solve such problems, but they are
never top of mind.

</Basic>

<Basic>

# Critical Agency

Employees of Springest are expected to have a **proactive attitude** towards
finding answers and solutions. In practice, not everyone turns out to be equally
capable of handling this responsibility.

</Basic>

<Basic>

# Smooth Onboarding

Even the most promising talents will not immediately meet the high demands of
Springest. As a result, **aligning expectations** of exisiting and new
employees can be challenging.

</Basic>

---

<Basic>

# Visible Milestones

Not all messages are created equal, but in collaborative messaging apps they are
presented as such. One of the drawbacks of a stream-based approach is that
even **major milestones** disappear too quickly.

</Basic>

<Basic>

# Meaningful Metrics

Getting the right answers alone is not enough. Having insight in the queries
requested by your employees tells a lot about your organization and its
challenges. This critical **feedback data** is often elusive.
